ABOUT ME

I graduated Magnum Cum Laude from Loyola University of New Orleans in May of 2018 with a bachelor's of accountancy and a bachelors in finance.
Currently I'm enrolled in Loyola's Software Development and Coding Program learning to become a full stack developer while studying for the CPA Exam.
I'm fascinated by the tech industry with a passion to solve problems either through creation or fixing an extisting problem.
After completion of the Software Development and Coding Program, I envision myself becoming a developer with a focus on the business aspect or an IT auditor.
